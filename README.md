# Project Overview

After reviewing our analysis over the weather, W. Avy wanted more information about temperature trends before opening up his surf shop. Specifcally, Avy wanted temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu in order to see if his shop would be sustainable year-round.

## Results

Comparing the two months, June assumed to be the hottest month of the year and December assumed to be the coldest, we can decide if the surf/ice cream shop will be viable. Let's go into detail within the data:

The maximum temperature for both months are within the 80's so we can assume that the ice cream sales will be sustainable during those peak temperatures. We can also assume that people will most likely want to cool down in the water as well so they might be surfing which makes that part of the shop viable as well.
The average temperature throughout the months are both in the 70's, so again, the ice cream sales will be sustainable. We can also assume that the surfing will still be viable as well.
The minimum temperature for June will be in the 60's and the 50's for December. If the temperatures reach the lower end of each month, it might be reasonable to assume that the shop will have less traffic as opposed to the higher temperature days. The surfing might be more sustainable as opposed to the ice cream portion of the shop.

## Summary

We concluded that because of the temperature average and peak that traffic would presumably be consistent in regards to sales in surfing and ice cream. However, I do think it would be a good idea to run additional queries in order to refine and detail our analysis. Something as simple as maybe precipitation in order to account for bad weather or storms, or maybe wind levels in order to determine wave height/consistency.
